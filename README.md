Hi!

I am applying for the Junior Front End position and have done the code challenge!
When fetching from Modernas API i experienced problems due to Access-Control-Allow-Origin header was not present and my code was not on the same domain. I worked around this by creating my own api.json and fetched from that instead.

I am using Sass.
Start by running: npm run build

Cheers!
Roberta
